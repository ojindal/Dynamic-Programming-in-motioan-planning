# ECE276B SP21 HW1 Programming Assignment

There are two '.py' files:

1) utils.py -- This needs to be run first as its functions are utilized in the main file
		This file includes the Label Correcting Algorithm for both parts (named: dp)
		along with some helper functions.

2) doorkey.py -- This is the main file and is executing part A and B
		The Label Correcting Algorithm of utils.py is used in
			this file's function "doorkey_problem"

		Just uncomment the part which need to be run (A or B)
			and comment the other after "if __name__ == '__main__':"

There are two folders containing the gifs:

1) part A gifs -- This includes all the resulting gifs for given problems(including example).

1) part B gifs -- This includes gifs for part B with all three possible combinations of two doors.
			i.e., Both closed, Both open, One close one open.

To run this code, you need to change the path in the code (partA() and partB()) according to your data location.

Thank you.
